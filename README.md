# Canvas Scripts
This repo demonstrates samples of the scripts I use to run my day-to-day operations as an LMS admin. 
I use a combination of SQL, Ruby, and Python to integrate and automate various Canvas processes and integrations.

The samples included in this repo, along with other scripts, were developed to perform some of the following tasks:
- Setup an integration between Canvas LMS and Jenzabar SIS
- Develop an integration between Canvas and third-party applications and partners
- Automate some of the redundant work
- Track student activity for security and academic integrity purposes
- Provide analytics to the student behavior on Canvas LMS
- Produce engaging content using CSS and JavaScript
